@article{2,
	abstract = {A challenging target in the noncovalent synthesis of nanostructured functional materials is the formation of uniform features that exhibit well-defined properties, e.g., precise control over the aggregate shape, size, and stability. In particular, for aqueous-based one-dimensional supramolecular polymers, this is a daunting task. Here we disclose a strategy based on self-assembling discotic amphiphiles that leads to the control over stack length and shape of ordered, chiral columnar aggregates. By balancing out attractive noncovalent forces within the hydrophobic core of the polymerizing building blocks with electrostatic repulsive interactions on the hydrophilic rim we managed to switch from elongated, rod-like assemblies to small and discrete objects. Intriguingly this rod-to-sphere transition is expressed in a loss of cooperativity in the temperature-dependent self-assembly mechanism. The aggregates were characterized using circular dichroism, UV and 1H-NMR spectroscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, and cryotransmission electron microscopy. In analogy to many systems found in biology, mechanistic details of the self-assembly pathways emphasize the importance of cooperativity as a key feature that dictates the physical properties of the produced supramolecular polymers.},

Several experimental and theoretical techniques (cryo-TEM{,} AFM{,} DSC{,} circular dichroism (CD){,} molecular mechanics calculations and CD simulations) were used to describe the formation and the characteristics of the chiral supramolecular structures and fibers constituting the gel. The chirality at both supramolecular and microscopic level depends on the configuration of the stereogenic centers of the pyrrolidine unit. The gels formed by the two enantiomers of the gelator and their mixtures display enantiomeric discrimination resulting in a self-sorting process. In fact{,} separate fibers of opposite helicity are obtained{,} which suggests this class of compounds has strong potential for realizing functionalized chiral architectures.},
