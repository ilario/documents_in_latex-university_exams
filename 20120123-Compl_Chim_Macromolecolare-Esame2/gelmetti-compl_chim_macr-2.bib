	abstract = {Modern man-made engineering materials demonstrate excellent mechanical properties, but the lack of the ability of self healing, i.e. the ability to remove or neutralise microcracks without (much) intentional human interaction, which is typical for most materials as encountered in nature. Such self-healing behaviour requires the presence of mobile species, atoms or molecules, in an otherwise solid material. Upon the occurrence of damage the mobile species directionally flow towards the damage location and once arrived there restores the contact between the two crack faces and the mechanical integrity. This directional flow may occur during regular use conditions (self healing behaviour) or conditions during which the mobility is temporarily increased (stimulated self healing). In this manuscript a brief overview of the routes and mechanisms which have been used to create self healing behaviour in the principal classes of engineering materials: polymers, metals, ceramics, concrete, asphalt, fibre composites, is presented.},

@article{ottico,
	abstract = {Polyurethanes have many properties that qualify them as high-performance polymeric materials, but they still suffer from mechanical damage. We report the development of polyurethane networks that exhibit self-repairing characteristics upon exposure to ultraviolet light. The network consists of an oxetane-substituted chitosan precursor incorporated into a two-component polyurethane. Upon mechanical damage of the network, four-member oxetane rings open to create two reactive ends. When exposed to ultraviolet light, chitosan chain scission occurs, which forms crosslinks with the reactive oxetane ends, thus repairing the network. These materials are capable of repairing themselves in less than an hour and can be used in many coatings applications, ranging from transportation to packaging or fashion and biomedical industries.},

@article{diffusione,
	abstract = {Self-healing resin systems have been discussed for over a decade and four different technologies had been proposed. However, little work on their application as composite matrices has been published although this was one of the stated aims of the earliest work in the field. This paper reports on the optimization of a solid-state self-healing resin system and its subsequent use as a matrix for high volume fraction glass fibre-reinforced composites. The resin system was optimized using Charpy impact testing and repeated healing, while the efficiency of healing in composites was determined by analysing the growth of delaminations following repeated impacts with or without a healing cycle. To act as a reference, a non-healing resin system was subjected to the same treatments and the results are compared with the healable system. The optimized resin system displays a healing efficiency of 65\% after the first healing cycle, dropping to 35 and 30\% after the second and third healing cycles, respectively. Correction for any healability due to further curing showed that approximately 50\% healing efficiency could be achieved with the bisphenol A-based epoxy resin containing 7.5\% of polybisphenol-A-co-epichlorohydrin. The composite, on the other hand, displays a healing efficiency of approximately 30\%. It is therefore clear that the solid-state self-healing system is capable of healing transverse cracks and delaminations in a composite, but that more work is needed to optimize matrix healing within a composite and to develop a methodology for assessing recovery in performance.},

@article{transesterificazione,
	abstract = {Permanently cross-linked materials have outstanding mechanical properties and solvent resistance, but they cannot be processed and reshaped once synthesized. Non--cross-linked polymers and those with reversible cross-links are processable, but they are soluble. We designed epoxy networks that can rearrange their topology by exchange reactions without depolymerization and showed that they are insoluble and processable. Unlike organic compounds and polymers whose viscosity varies abruptly near the glass transition, these networks show Arrhenius-like gradual viscosity variations like those of vitreous silica. Like silica, the materials can be wrought and welded to make complex objects by local heating without the use of molds. The concept of a glass made by reversible topology freezing in epoxy networks can be readily scaled up for applications and generalized to other chemistries.},

The unidirectional design of the binding sites prevents uncontrolled multidirectional association or gelation. Linear polymers and reversible networks were formed from monomers with two and three binding sites, respectively. The thermal and environmental control over lifetime and bond strength makes many properties, such as viscosity, chain length, and composition, tunable in a way not accessible to traditional polymers. Hence, polymer networks with thermodynamically controlled architectures can be formed, for use in, for example, coatings and hot melts, where a reversible, strongly temperature-dependent rheology is highly advantageous.},
